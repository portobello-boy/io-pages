Hey there.

My name is Daniel Millson, thanks for coming by to my blog. This is just a place for me to jot down my thoughts about stuff I'm working on or learning about, and I hope you'll find some of the content interesting or inspiring in some way.

Here's a little bit about me. Growing up, I was fortunate to be able to travel, spending most of my pre-university years in South America and various countries in southern Africa, such as South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. 

I had no idea I would end up studying Mathematics and Computer Science until I started at my university, where I ended up enjoying those subjects more than I would have imagined. While may day-to-day job is as a software developer in the financial service industry, I have a passion for learning different subjects in Math (though I'm by no means a mathematician).

Other than writing software and learning Math, my hobbies include reading, cooking, and GeoCaching. I may post some content here regarding those, so keep your eyes out for those!

Again, thanks for coming by, and I hope you have a great day.
